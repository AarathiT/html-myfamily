<h1>He is our prince charming..</h1>
<p> At 13 months old, my baby boy is a bundle of energy, curiosity, and pure joy.<br\>
    Each day with him is filled with new discoveriesâ€”whether he's taking wobbly steps,<br\> 
    babbling with excitement, or laughing at the simplest things. <br\>
    His tiny hands love to explore everything around him, and his smile can brighten even the busiest day. <br\>
    He's starting to show his personality more and more, full of determination, wonder, and affection. <br\>
    Watching him grow and learn is a beautiful reminder of how magical these early moments in life truly are.</p>
